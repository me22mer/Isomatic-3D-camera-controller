## Features
- **Smooth Following**: Follows a target object with adjustable smoothness.
- **Panning**: Move the camera using keyboard input with optional movement limits.
- **Zooming**: Adjust zoom level with mouse scroll with min/max zoom constraints.
- **Rotation**: Rotate the camera using right mouse drag with smooth transition.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or copy the `CameraController.cs` script into your Unity project.
2. Attach the `CameraController` script to your **Main Camera** or any desired camera GameObject.
3. Assign a target to `FollowAt` if needed.

## Setup
1. Create an **empty GameObject** named `Camera Controller`.
2. Move the **Main Camera** inside `Camera Controller`.

```
Camera Controller/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Main Camera
```

3. Set the **Transform** of `Camera Controller` to:
   - Position: `x = 0, y = 0, z = 0`
   - Rotation: `x = 0, y = 0, z = 0`
4. Set the **Transform** of `Main Camera` to:
   - Position: `x = -25, y = 20, z = -25` (This is a suggested viewpoint; feel free to adjust for the best angle using the **Move Tool** blue arrow to adjust position be careful while moving.)
   - Rotation: `x = 30, y = 45, z = 0`
5. Set the **Projection** of `Main Camera` to `Orthographic`.

## Usage
### 1. Follow Settings
- `FollowAt`: Assign a Transform to make the camera follow that object.
- `FollowSmoothness`: Adjusts how smoothly the camera follows the target.

### 2. Panning Settings
- `EnablePanLimitX` / `EnablePanLimitZ`: Enable or disable movement constraints.
- `PanLimitX` / `PanLimitZ`: Set min and max limits for panning.
- `PanSpeed`: Adjusts the speed of panning.

### 3. Zoom Settings
- `ZoomSpeed`: Controls how fast the zooming occurs.
- `ZoomSmoothness`: Controls the smoothness of zooming.
- `MinZoom` / `MaxZoom`: Set limits for zooming.

### 4. Rotation Settings
- `RotationSpeed`: Controls how fast the camera rotates.
- Right mouse button (`Mouse 1`): Drag to rotate.
- Auto-snaps to 45-degree increments when released.

## Controls
| Action       | Input |
